#Let's Try Again
Programming Assignment 03 - CSE 2341 - Spring 2016

#### Due Feb 22 by 8am pushed to Github and pull request issued.

While some submissions went well, there were some struggles with Program 1 - Word Search.  We're going to give you the opportunity to re-do and re-submit the program as programming assignment 03.  Just to be clear, **the grades for Program 1 will stand** (questions about some of the grades notwithstanding). 

Every program submission has room for improvement.  That can come in the form of coding style, documentation, etc.  We will provide a list of general observations for everyone to think about and review; you also need to pay special attention to any comments that were made by your TA both on GitHub and the comments they left on Canvas.  

Here are some things to keep in mind:
  * Your grade on Program 03 will NOT replace your grade on Program 01.
  * Functional requirements for Program 03 remain exactly the same as Program 01.
  * There is no guarantee that the grade your received on Program 01 will be your minimum possible score for Program 03.  
  * If you were happy with your score for program 01, don't think there's any room for improvement in your code base, and don't want to make any updates, **you still must submit your code in the Program 03 folder on Github**.   
  * There will be NO late submissions allowed for PA 03.  None.  Zero.  Zippo.  Nada.  Zilch!
