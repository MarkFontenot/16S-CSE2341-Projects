#Let's Try Again
Programming Assignment 03 - CSE 2341 - Spring 2016

#### Due Feb 22 by 8am pushed to Github and pull request issued.

While some submissions went well, there were some struggles with Program 1 - Word Search.  We're going to give you the opportunity to re-do and re-submit the program as programming assignment 03.  Just to be clear, **the grades for Program 1 will stand** (questions about some of the grades notwithstanding). 

Here are some things to keep in mind:
  * Your grade on Program 03 will NOT replace your grade on Program 01.
  * Requirements for Program 03 remain exactly the same as Program 01.
  * If you were happy with your score for program 01 and don't want to make any updates, **you still must submit your code in the Program 03 folder on Github**.  
  * There will be NO late submissions allowed for PA 03.  None.  Zero.  Zippo.  Nada.  Zilch!
